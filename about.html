        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Abraxas Wax began as a small passion project among Eau Claire music lovers. What started with a few crates of classic rock LPs has grown into one of the city's favorite stops for vinyl collectors, casual listeners, and curious newcomers.</p>

        <h3>Why Vinyl?</h3>
        <p>We believe in the warmth, character, and soul of analog sound. Vinyl invites us to slow down, appreciate the music, and rediscover the experience of listening with intention.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>To share the magic of physical music, support the local arts scene, and provide a welcoming space for everyone. From seasoned crate diggers to students finding their first record.</p>

        <h3>Visit the Shop</h3>
        <p>Stop by to browse new releases, rare finds, local artists, and staff-picked favorites. We're proud to be part of Eau Claire's creative community.</p>
